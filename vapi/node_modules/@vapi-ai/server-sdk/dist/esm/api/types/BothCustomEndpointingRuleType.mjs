 * This endpointing rule is based on both the last assistant message and the current customer message as they are speaking.
 *
 * Flow:
 * - Assistant speaks
 * - Customer starts speaking
 * - Customer transcription comes in
 * - This rule is evaluated on the last assistant message and the current customer transcription
 * - If assistant message matches `assistantRegex` AND customer message matches `customerRegex`, the endpointing timeout is set to `timeoutSeconds`
 *
 * Usage:
 * - If you want to wait longer while customer is speaking numbers, you can set a longer timeout.
