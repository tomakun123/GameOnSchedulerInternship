 * This message is triggered when the tool call is delayed.
 *
 * There are the two things that can trigger this message:
 * 1. The user talks with the assistant while your server is processing the request. Default is "Sorry, a few more seconds."
 * 2. The server doesn't respond within `timingMilliseconds`.
 *
 * This message is never triggered for async tool calls.
