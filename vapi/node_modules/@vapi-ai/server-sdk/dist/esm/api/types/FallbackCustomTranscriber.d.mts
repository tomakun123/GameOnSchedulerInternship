     * This is where the transcription request will be sent.
     *
     * Usage:
     * 1. Vapi will initiate a websocket connection with `server.url`.
     *
     * 2. Vapi will send an initial text frame with the sample rate. Format:
     * ```
     *     {
     *       "type": "start",
     *       "encoding": "linear16", // 16-bit raw PCM format
     *       "container": "raw",
     *       "sampleRate": {{sampleRate}},
     *       "channels": 2 // customer is channel 0, assistant is channel 1
     *     }
     * ```
     *
     * 3. Vapi will send the audio data in 16-bit raw PCM format as binary frames.
     *
     * 4. You can read the messages something like this:
     * ```
     * ws.on('message', (data, isBinary) => {
     *   if (isBinary) {
     *     pcmBuffer = Buffer.concat([pcmBuffer, data]);
     *     console.log(`Received PCM data, buffer size: ${pcmBuffer.length}`);
     *   } else {
     *     console.log('Received message:', JSON.parse(data.toString()));
     *   }
     * });
     * ```
     *
     * 5. You will respond with transcriptions as you have them. Format:
     * ```
     *  {
     *     "type": "transcriber-response",
     *     "transcription": "Hello, world!",
     *     "channel": "customer" | "assistant"
     *  }
     * ```
     */
