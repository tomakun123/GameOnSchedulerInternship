     * Hot tip:
     * - In JavaScript, escape `\` when sending the regex pattern. Eg. `"hello\sthere"` will be sent over the wire as `"hellosthere"`. Send `"hello\\sthere"` instead.
     * - `RegExp.test` does substring matching, so `/cat/.test("I love cats")` will return `true`. To do full string matching, send "^cat$".
