     * This is the plan that controls the variable extraction from the user's responses.

     * Usage:
     * Use `schema` to specify what you want to extract from the user's responses.
     * ```json
     * {
     *   "schema": {
     *     "type": "object",
     *     "properties": {
     *       "user": {
     *         "type": "object",
     *         "properties": {
     *           "name": {
     *             "type": "string"
     *           },
     *           "age": {
     *             "type": "number"
     *           }
     *         }
     *       }
     *     }
     *   }
     * }
     * ```
     *
     * This will be extracted as `{{ user.name }}` and `{{ user.age }}` respectively.
     *
     * (Optional) Use `aliases` to create new variables.
     *
     * ```json
     * {
     *   "aliases": [
     *     {
     *       "key": "userAge",
     *       "value": "{{user.age}}"
     *     },
     *     {
     *       "key": "userName",
     *       "value": "{{user.name}}"
     *     }
     *   ]
     * }
     * ```
     *
     * This will be extracted as `{{ userAge }}` and `{{ userName }}` respectively.
     *
     * Note: The `schema` field is required for Conversation nodes if you want to extract variables from the user's responses. `aliases` is just a convenience.
