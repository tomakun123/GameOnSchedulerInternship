/**
 * This endpointing rule is based on the last assistant message before customer started speaking.
 *
 * Flow:
 * - Assistant speaks
 * - Customer starts speaking
 * - Customer transcription comes in
 * - This rule is evaluated on the last assistant message
 * - If a match is found based on `regex`, the endpointing timeout is set to `timeoutSeconds`
 *
 * Usage:
 * - If you have yes/no questions in your use case like "are you interested in a loan?", you can set a shorter timeout.
 * - If you have questions where the customer may pause to look up information like "what's my account number?", you can set a longer timeout.
