     * A formula is created by using the query names as the variable.
     * The formulas must contain at least one query name in the LiquidJS format {{query_name}} or {{['query name']}} which will be substituted with the query result.
     * For example, if you have 2 queries, 'Was Booking Made' and 'Average Call Duration', you can create a formula like this:

     * {{['Query 1']}} / {{['Query 2']}} * 100
