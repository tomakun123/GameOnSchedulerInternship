 * This determines whether metadata is sent in requests to the custom provider.
 *
 * - `off` will not send any metadata. payload will look like `{ messages }`
 * - `variable` will send `assistant.metadata` as a variable on the payload. payload will look like `{ messages, metadata }`
 * - `destructured` will send `assistant.metadata` fields directly on the payload. payload will look like `{ messages, ...metadata }`
 *
 * Further, `variable` and `destructured` will send `call`, `phoneNumber`, and `customer` objects in the payload.
 *
 * Default is `variable`.
