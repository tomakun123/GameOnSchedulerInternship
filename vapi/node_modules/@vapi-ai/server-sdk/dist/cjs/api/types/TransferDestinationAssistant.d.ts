In this scenario, you likely also want to set `assistant.firstMessageMode=assistant-speaks-first-with-model-generated-message` for the destination assistant.
     *
     * This accepts a string or a ToolMessageStart class. Latter is useful if you want to specify multiple messages for different languages through the `contents` field.

     * - `rolling-history`: This is the default mode. It keeps the entire conversation history and appends the new assistant's system message on transfer.
     *
     *   Example:
     *
     *   Pre-transfer:
     *     system: assistant1 system message
     *     assistant: assistant1 first message
     *     user: hey, good morning
