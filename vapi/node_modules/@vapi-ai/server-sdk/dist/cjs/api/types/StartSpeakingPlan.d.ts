     * Example:
     * - If model generates tokens and voice generates bytes within 100ms, the pipeline still waits 300ms before outputting speech.

     * - If the customer is taking long pauses, set this to a higher value.
     * - If the assistant is accidentally jumping in too much, set this to a higher value.

     * - If you have yes/no questions like "are you interested in a loan?", you can set a shorter timeout.
