In this scenario, you likely also want to set `assistant.firstMessageMode=assistant-speaks-first-with-model-generated-message` for the destination assistant.

     * This accepts a string or a ToolMessageStart class. Latter is useful if you want to specify multiple messages for different languages through the `contents` field.
